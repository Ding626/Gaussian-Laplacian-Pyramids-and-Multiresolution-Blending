# Gaussian, Laplacian Pyramids and Multiresolution Blending

The objective was to generate Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids of an image and also check if the pyramids consolidated back to the original image. Multiresolution blending was tested to see how images can be
blended together seamlessly.

## Gaussian & Laplacian Pyramids

An elephant image was used for creating both the pyramids and reconstruction of that image.

The Gaussian pyramid obtained was-

The reconstructed image using the Laplacian pyramid of the elephant was-
